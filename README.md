## Purpose  
When investing, the following concerns arise:  
- Not wanting to research the internal components of ETFs.  
- Wanting to identify assets with stable dividends and consistent fill rates.  
- Also wanting to know if the financial ratios of these assets are solid and if there are investment risks.  
So we create a dashboard to address the above concerns and organize our own high-yield ETFs. The goal is to achieve automatic data updates, eliminating the need for manual collection of raw data and report generation. This dashboard will identify high-yield and stable fill-rate assets while simultaneously displaying their financial ratio performance to confirm investment risks.
